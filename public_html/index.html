                <p>Dear Hiring Manager:</p>
<p>I am writing to express my interest in you position on Indeed.com as a Web Producer at Eventcore in Seattle, WA. Having recently completed a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Systems from University of Washington Tacoma, I am looking for an entry level position in the web development field and am confident that I can make a positive contribution to a software development team.</p>
<p>I have skills in multiple areas of the software development life cycle, including collecting and analyzing requirements, OOP design with UML diagrams, database design, and unit testing. I am currently working to develop my skills in front-end and full-stack web development, focusing on jQuery, Angular.js, Node.js, and Bootstrap. I also have a strong passion for UX design, including accessibility. One of my main strengths is in relational database design, including normalization and ER diagrams. I originally learned HTML and CSS through W3 Schools and by copying and changing existing web sites. I continue to keep up with new industry techniques like HTML5 and CSS preprocessors through online classes like the ones on Coursera, Udacity and Microsoft Virtual Academy.</p>
<p>I believe I would be a versatile member of a web development team and able to learn new skills quickly and fill in for other areas as needed. I currently live in Federal Way, WA and plan on moving closer to Seattle in the near future. My salary requirements are $38,000 to $40,000 and I can start working as soon as possible. I look forward to the opportunity to use my skills to contribute to the growth of your company. Please call me at 253-334-9561 or email at stewak5@uw.edu to arrange an interview. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing more about this opportunity!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Kimberly Stewart</p>
